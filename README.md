## Starting guide

For simplicity since the project is small I only used Main class. 

Moreover, due to the requirement to only use jdk, I did not used any build tools like maven or gradle. 

For testing I performed only manual testing, as I don't have any testing framework installed and only use pure jdk.

### 1. Install dependencies

`
Java jdk 21 Eclipse Temurin  
` 

### 2. Clone the repository

`
git clone <URL>
`
or simply download the zip file and extract it.

### 3. Build the project

`
cd <project-directory>
`

`
cd src
`

`
javac Main.java
`

### 4. Run the project

`java Main <URL>`
